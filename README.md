# risingcode.net Project Template
This is the Project Description.
* Author: Jean Mattes
* Author-URI: https://risingcode.net/
* License: CC-BY 4.0 / MIT

## Goal
This Folder serves as a Meta Level to organize Projects.

## Usage
* The Repository of Code / Content goes into the ``repo`` folder.
* The folder ``excluded`` holds files/folder with context to the 
  repo which should not be in version control, e.g., Binaries.
* All the files and folders not yet extensive enough for their 
  proper storage can reside in the ``misc`` folder.
* This ``README.md`` can serve as the Meta Level Project Description.

## Installation
Agnostic to Version Control, example with git:

* Clone Template: ``git clone ``
* Clone Project Repo: ``git clone https://your.domain/your/repo.git repo``
